== Description ==

This plugin removes rel="noreferrer" from post's links on the frontend.

It works only on single posts and doesn't work on index page. I think it needs to be updated as soon as possible. Write me a message to [support@gruz0.ru](mailto:support@gruz0.ru) what do you think about it, please.
